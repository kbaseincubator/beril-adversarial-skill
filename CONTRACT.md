# Cross-skill interop contract

**Status:** Authored alongside v0.6.0 (2026-05-02). Updated for v0.7.0 (2026-05-03). Version-pinned
contract for downstream consumers of beril-adversarial.

---

## v0.7.0 migration (READ THIS FIRST if you're a consumer)

v0.7.0 ships three breaking changes bundled into one schema bump
(`adversarial-review-{paper,presentation}.v3`):

**1. Class rename — `narrative_weakness` → `central_objection`.**
Same role (one finding per review, severity=info, deck/paper-wide
synthesis — the killshot a peer reviewer would land). Renamed because
"narrative_weakness" was being misread as a quality judgment rather
than the function ("identify the central thing the work needs to
defend against"). Consumer code matching `class == "narrative_weakness"`
must switch to `class == "central_objection"`. v3 docs containing
the dead class name are HARD-REJECTED by the validator (not auto-
corrected) with a migration error message.

**2. New class on presentation — `citation_reality`.** Already in
paper since v2; presentation v3 adopts it for parity. Detects
fabricated/drifting citations on slides with citation surfaces
(footers, in-text markers, `provenance_pin` blocks). Consumers
parsing presentation v3 JSON should route `citation_reality` findings
appropriately. NEW required field: `citation_id` (string identifier
of the cited source — bibtex key, DOI, REPORT.md section reference).

**3. CLI `--output` flag now HONORED for `--type paper|presentation`.**
In v0.6.x, `--output` was silently ignored for these modes. In
v0.7.0 it works: `--output myreview` writes to
`<draft_dir>/audit/myreview.{md,json}` instead of the canonical
`audit/adversarial_review.{md,json}`. **Consumer-visible behavior
change:** if your orchestrator was passing `--output` thinking it was
a no-op, audit your assumptions — output paths will now differ. v2
callers that don't pass `--output` see no difference.

**Asymmetric class renumbering** (documentation-internal, not
schema-affecting): paper.v3 keeps the same class numbers as paper.v2
(rename is in-place; central_objection remains Class 10).
Presentation.v3 inserts citation_reality as Class 6, bumping
missing_slide 6→7 and central_objection 7→8. The `class` field is
the canonical identifier; numbers only matter when reading the
prompts.

**`citation_id` semantic note.** On presentation v3, `citation_id`
may hold REPORT.md section references (e.g., `"REPORT§Finding 7"`),
DOIs, or bibtex keys — any string identifier of the cited source.
Consumers should not assume bibtex format.

**v2 deprecation policy.** v2 acceptance remains until both consumer
teams (paper-writer, presentation-maker) confirm v3 adoption in
production. Removal is event-driven, not calendar-driven. v2 docs
emit a deprecation warning (exit 2) but parse cleanly.

**Forensic compatibility.** v0.6.x audit files containing
`narrative_weakness` (v2 schema) remain readable by the v0.7.0
validator. The rename applies only to v3 schema. Re-processing old
audit files does NOT require updating them.

### Quick consumer migration checklist

For both paper-writer and presentation-maker:

1. Update class enum dispatch: `narrative_weakness` → `central_objection`. Optionally accept BOTH for one transition release.
2. If your orchestrator passes `--output`, audit assumptions — output paths now differ.
3. Update any test fixtures emitting v2 docs to emit v3.
4. **Add a consumer-side smoke test** (cross-skill drift mitigation per `feedback_cross_skill_contract_drift.md`): assert your orchestrator's invocation of beril-adversarial exits 0, output file exists, JSON parses, `schema_version` matches expected.

For presentation-maker only:

5. Add `citation_reality` finding routing — the new class fires on slides with present-but-questionable citation surfaces (footer, in-text marker, or `provenance_pin`). Recommend surfacing to user for review (citations need human verification, not auto-revision).

This doc pins the interop surface that other skills (beril-paper-writer,
beril-presentation-maker) depend on. Changes to this contract are
breaking changes for those consumers and require coordinated updates.
The recurring failure mode it prevents is documented in memory entry
`feedback_cross_skill_contract_drift.md` — drift between paper-writer
v0.6.x output structure and the adversarial paper reviewer's input
expectations cost paper-writer two release cycles and forced an inline
fallback reviewer as a workaround.

---

## CLI surface (programmatic invocation)

```
beril-adversarial review <target> --type {paper|presentation|plan|project} [options]
```

For `--type paper` and `--type presentation`: `<target>` is an
**absolute path to the per-draft directory**.

For `--type plan` and `--type project`: `<target>` is a **project_id**
(directory name under `projects/`).

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning | Consumer policy |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Review completed clean | Use the JSON freely |
| 1 | User error (bad args, validation failure) | Surface to user; don't retry |
| 2 | Validator auto-corrected summary mismatches OR advisory warnings | The JSON is consumer-safe; proceed |
| 3 | Config error (claude CLI missing, prompt missing) | Surface; user must install/configure |

The wrapper is a thin Python delegation to `tools/adversarial_review.sh`;
exit codes propagate through unchanged.

---

## Paper review interop (`--type paper`)

### Required inputs (read by the reviewer)

The reviewer expects **paper-writer v0.6+ per-draft directory layout**:

```
projects/<project_id>/papers/draft_N/
├── manuscript.md           ← REQUIRED — assembled draft
├── 00_throughline.md       ← REQUIRED — chosen throughline + evidence map
├── references.md           ← REQUIRED — bibliography (markdown form)
├── citation_map.md         ← REQUIRED — claim→citation contract (NOTE: underscore, not hyphen)
├── reframing_log.md        ← OPTIONAL — auditable REPORT-drift acknowledgments (warns if absent — report_drift detection lacks context)
├── methods_provenance.md   ← OPTIONAL — tools/versions/snapshots
├── figures_inventory.md    ← OPTIONAL
├── tables_inventory.md     ← OPTIONAL (v0.6+ tables pipeline)
└── audit/                  ← created by the reviewer
```

Plus from the project root:
```
projects/<project_id>/
├── REPORT.md               ← REQUIRED — truth source for quantitative grounding
└── RESEARCH_PLAN.md        ← OPTIONAL — design intent for missing-section detection
```

If `manuscript.md` is missing AND the parent directory contains
flat-file drafts (`papers/draft{N}.md`), the reviewer emits a clear
migration message — legacy flat-file layout is NOT supported in
v0.6.0 (clean break per SCHEMA_V2_PAPER_DECISIONS.md).

### Output contract (written by the reviewer)

```
projects/<project_id>/papers/draft_N/audit/
├── adversarial_review.md   ← human-readable report
└── adversarial_review.json ← machine-readable; consumer contract
```

**Both files are written on every run.** Output paths are deterministic
(no auto-numbering); existing files are overwritten. Consumers should
move/rename old `audit/` directories before re-running if they need
to preserve prior reviews.

### JSON schema (`adversarial-review-paper.v2`)

See `SCHEMA_V2_PAPER_DECISIONS.md` for full design rationale. Quick
reference:

- **Single `findings[]` array.** No `deck_level_findings` field.
- **Section-level findings** have `section`, `line_range`,
  `paragraph_quote` (paragraph_quote is class-conditional —
  required for register_drift / claim_evidence /
  unbacked_quantitative / report_drift; optional for other
  classes).
- **Manuscript-wide findings** (narrative_weakness, missing_section,
  abstract_body_mismatch, throughline) OMIT `section` and the
  other section-level fields.
- **Severity:** P0 / P1 / P2 / info. info reserved for the single
  narrative_weakness finding.
- **Class enum (10 classes):**
  - Shared with presentation: `claim_evidence`,
    `unbacked_quantitative`, `register_drift`, `narrative_weakness`,
    `throughline`
  - Format-specific (paper-equivalent): `missing_section`,
    `section_arc`
  - Paper-only: `citation_reality`, `report_drift`,
    `abstract_body_mismatch`
- **`fix_target` values** (paper-writer prompt names): `methods.v1.md`,
  `results.v1.md`, `discussion.v1.md`, `introduction.v1.md`,
  `abstract.v1.md`, `limitations.v1.md`, `references.v1.md`,
  `00_throughline.md`, `reframing_log.md`, `manuscript.v1.md`.

### Auto-correction behavior

If the LLM's `summary` block disagrees with the actual `findings[]`
counts, the validator REWRITES the JSON with the derived summary,
preserves the LLM's original miscount to
`<draft_dir>/audit/adversarial_review.original-summary.json`, and
exits 2 (advisory). The .json is consumer-safe.

Findings array is the ground truth; consumers should parse
`findings[]` directly rather than trusting the summary block (the
summary block is for human readers and should now match thanks to
auto-correction, but the array is canonical).

---

## Presentation review interop (`--type presentation`)

### Required inputs

Presentation-maker per-draft directory (v0.3.1+ four-zone layout
— `deliverable/`, `narrative/`, `working/`, `audit/`):

```
projects/<project_id>/talks/draft_N/
├── working/slide_spec.json              ← REQUIRED
├── working/03_slides/qa_anticipated.json ← REQUIRED
├── narrative/00_throughline.md          ← REQUIRED
├── narrative/02_substories.md           ← REQUIRED
├── working/04_speaker_notes/            ← optional (read if present)
└── audit/                               ← created by the reviewer
```

The orchestrator's input-resolution block (`adversarial_review.sh`,
added v0.5.2) auto-detects layout. v0.3.0 and earlier drafts use
the legacy top-level layout instead:

```
projects/<project_id>/talks/draft_N/
├── slide_spec.json
├── 00_throughline.md
├── 02_substories.md
├── 03_slides/qa_anticipated.json
└── audit/
```

The script probes for `working/slide_spec.json` first; if absent,
falls back to top-level paths. **Consumers don't need to know which
layout their draft uses** — the orchestrator handles both
transparently. The four-file requirement is the same in both
layouts; only the paths differ.

### Output contract

Same shape as paper:

```
projects/<project_id>/talks/draft_N/audit/
├── adversarial_review.md
└── adversarial_review.json
```

### JSON schema (`adversarial-review-presentation.v2`)

See `SCHEMA_V2_DECISIONS.md` for full design. Same architectural
patterns as paper.v2 (single array; locus signaled by `slide_id`
presence; class-conditional `title_quote`; auto-correction).

Presentation v1 (`adversarial-review-presentation.v1`) is still
accepted by the validator with a deprecation warning, for forensic
compatibility with audit files from v0.4.x runs.

---

## Schema family compatibility matrix

| Schema | Status | Validator behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `adversarial-review-presentation.v1` | Deprecated since v0.5.0 | Accepted; deprecation warning; exit 2 |
| `adversarial-review-presentation.v2` | Deprecated as of v0.7.0 | Accepted; deprecation warning; exit 2 |
| `adversarial-review-presentation.v3` | **Current (v0.7.0+)** | Accepted; full validation; D1/D2 enforcement |
| `adversarial-review-paper.v2` | Deprecated as of v0.7.0 | Accepted; deprecation warning; exit 2 |
| `adversarial-review-paper.v3` | **Current (v0.7.0+)** | Accepted; full validation; D1/D2 enforcement |

**v3 enforcement (D1, D2 from SCHEMA_V3_DECISIONS.md):**
- D1: v3 docs containing the dead class name `narrative_weakness` are HARD-REJECTED (not auto-corrected). Use `central_objection` instead.
- D2: v3 docs with `citation_reality` findings MUST include a non-empty `citation_id` field. The validator rejects without it.

**v2 deprecation policy:** event-driven, not calendar-driven. v2 acceptance remains until both consumer teams confirm v3 adoption in production. Then removal lands in the next release. No fixed deadline.

Paper v1 is explicitly NOT a thing — paper schema launched directly at v2.

---

## Severity vocabulary mapping

The v2 schemas use `P0` / `P1` / `P2` / `info` for severity values
(bug-tracker conventions; "P0" carries clearer "blocks ship"
semantics than "Critical"). Legacy markdown reviewers (`--type
project` / `--type plan`) and paper-writer's
`fallback_reviewer.v1.md` use the older `Critical` / `Important` /
`Suggested` vocabulary.

Consumers parsing the v2 JSON who need the legacy form (e.g., for
display continuity with older tools) can apply this bijective
mapping:

| v2 schema severity | Legacy markdown severity | When used |
|---|---|---|
| `P0` | `Critical` | Blocks ship — fabricated number, broken figure link, silent REPORT drift, abstract overclaim, citation fabrication. Triggers consumer's revise loop. |
| `P1` | `Important` | Visible quality regression — register drift, citation drift, missing-section, structural arc issues. Surfaces in next_actions. |
| `P2` | `Suggested` | Polish — wording preferences, citation drift on non-load-bearing claims, vague evidence pointers. |
| `info` | _no legacy equivalent_ | Reserved for the single deck/paper-wide synthesis finding (`central_objection` in v3; `narrative_weakness` in v1/v2) — the killshot a peer reviewer would land, as a strategic note for the speaker / author. Not a fix-ticket. |

Example consumer-side translation in Python:

```python
SEVERITY_TO_LEGACY = {"P0": "critical", "P1": "important",
                     "P2": "suggested", "info": "central_objection"}

review = json.load(open("audit/adversarial_review.json"))
counts = {"critical": 0, "important": 0, "suggested": 0,
          "central_objection": 0}
for f in review["findings"]:
    counts[SEVERITY_TO_LEGACY[f["severity"]]] += 1
```

**We deliberately do NOT emit a `severity_label` convenience field
in the JSON.** Adding optional carrier fields invites schema bloat;
the mapping is bijective and trivially computed. If display
continuity matters to a consumer, compute it in their parser.

---

## Iteration pattern (running the reviewer multiple times per draft)

The default output paths
(`<draft_dir>/audit/adversarial_review.{md,json}`) **overwrite** on
each run. This is fine for single-shot audit (the canonical use
case: user reviews → fixes → re-runs to verify) but hostile to
scripted iteration loops that need to compare findings across
rounds.

If your consumer runs the reviewer multiple times per draft (e.g.,
inside a review-rewrite loop that wants to measure delta), use
ONE of these two patterns:

### Pattern A — `--output` flag (v0.6.x: legacy modes only)

The shell script's `--output` flag accepts a custom output basename.
**In v0.6.x, this flag is honored ONLY for `--type project|plan`
(legacy markdown reviewers).** For `--type paper|presentation`, the
flag is silently ignored — output always lands at the canonical
`<draft_dir>/audit/adversarial_review.{md,json}` paths.

For legacy modes (where `--output` works):

```bash
beril-adversarial review my_project \
    --type project \
    --output projects/my_project/ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_round_1.md
```

For `--type paper|presentation` in v0.6.x: **`--output` does
nothing.** Use Pattern B below. (Honoring `--output` for v2 schema
modes is on the v0.7+ punch list alongside the planned
`--auto-number` flag — see below.)

### Pattern B — Rename audit/ between runs (works universally)

Move the previous audit aside before re-running:

```bash
for round in 1 2 3; do
  beril-adversarial review "$draft_dir" --type paper
  if (( round < 3 )); then
    mv "$draft_dir/audit" "$draft_dir/audit-round-$round"
  fi
done
# After loop: audit-round-1/, audit-round-2/, audit/ (final round)
```

**Pattern B is the only working approach for `--type paper` and
`--type presentation` in v0.6.x.** It works identically across all
review types (legacy + v2 schemas). The full `audit/` directory is
preserved per round (including the auto-correction sidecar
`*.original-summary.json` if it fired). Recovery from a bad round
is `mv audit-round-N audit` — one step.

### Future: `--auto-number` flag (v0.7+)

A planned `--auto-number` flag for v0.7+ will, when set, name
outputs `adversarial_review_<N>.{md,json}` per run within `audit/`,
making Pattern A work without `--output` for paper and
presentation. **Default behavior in v0.6.x and after will remain
canonical-name overwrite** to avoid breaking existing consumers
(presentation-maker's `revise_loop.py` parses by canonical name).

---

## Validator ownership and shared-tool semantics

`tools/validate_presentation_review.py` (filename retained from
v0.5.x; handles both presentation v1+v2 and paper.v2 schemas as of
v0.6.0) is **owned by beril-adversarial-skill**. Both the
presentation-maker and paper-writer review-rewrite loops consume
its output (the validated/auto-corrected JSON) but should NOT
import or vendor it.

Why this matters:
- The validator implements the auto-correction behavior described
  above. Bypassing it means consumers see the LLM's miscounted
  summary block.
- Any schema additions (new classes, new optional fields) land
  here first. Consumers that re-implement validation will drift.
- The validator file is shipped inside this skill's wheel
  (`src/beril_adversarial/skill/tools/`) and deployed via
  `beril-adversarial install-skill <BERIL>`. Consumers should
  invoke `beril-adversarial review` (which runs the validator
  internally) and rely on its exit code, not call the validator
  directly.

If a consumer needs to re-validate a stored audit JSON
out-of-band, they MAY call the validator script directly via
`python3 <BERIL>/.claude/skills/beril-adversarial/tools/validate_presentation_review.py <path>`,
but this is a debugging convenience, not a contract surface.
Schema bumps may rename or relocate the script.

---

## Workflow example — paper-writer's perspective

The intended call flow when paper-writer wants a heavy adversarial
audit pass after assembling a draft. paper-writer's lighter
in-loop reviewer (`fallback_reviewer.v1.md`) keeps running per
drafting iteration; the canonical reviewer fires when paper-writer
wants the deeper audit (typically end of draft, before submission,
or before user review).

```bash
# Inside paper_writer.sh, after manuscript.md is assembled:
draft_dir="$PROJECT_DIR/papers/draft_$N"

# Invoke canonical reviewer via the CLI subcommand. Single source
# of truth; no need to know the deep filesystem path to the shell
# script.
beril-adversarial review "$draft_dir" --type paper
EXIT=$?

# Per-exit-code branching:
case $EXIT in
  0)
    # PASS — clean validation. JSON is consumer-safe.
    json="$draft_dir/audit/adversarial_review.json"
    md="$draft_dir/audit/adversarial_review.md"
    # Surface the .md to the user; route P0 findings from the JSON
    # to the planned v0.7+ review-rewrite loop.
    ;;
  2)
    # PASS-with-advisory: auto-correction or warnings fired.
    # The .json is still consumer-safe (validator rewrote the
    # summary block from the findings array). Sidecar at
    # <name>.original-summary.json preserves the LLM's miscount
    # for forensics. Treat the same as exit 0 for downstream
    # consumption; surface the auto-correction note to the user
    # if they want to debug LLM behavior.
    ;;
  1)
    # FAIL: an orchestrator-level hard error (e.g. the fusion path, or
    # output that failed structural validation). Effectively unreachable
    # on the single-reviewer path — as of v0.7.0.8 BOTH an unparseable
    # and a schema-invalid .json surface as exit 4, not 1. The .md may
    # still be useful; escalate.
    echo "Adversarial reviewer hard-failed; manual escalation needed" >&2
    ;;
  4)
    # .json NOT consumer-safe. As of v0.7.0.8, exit 0 is the ONLY code
    # that means consumer-safe; exit 4 means it is not. Two causes:
    #   (a) the .json does not parse and the orchestrator's automatic
    #       JSON-repair pass could not fix it (v0.7.0.7 — almost always
    #       an unescaped inner double-quote, per memory
    #       feedback_llm_json_unfixable_in_parser.md); or
    #   (b) the .json parses but is schema-invalid — missing required
    #       field, invalid enum, duplicate id, class invariant (v0.7.0.8;
    #       schema errors are not mechanically repairable, so no repair
    #       pass is attempted — fail loud).
    # Either way the .md report is intact and usable for human review;
    # the .json must NOT be parsed. The failure is content-dependent, so
    # one fresh re-run may produce a clean .json — but do not loop.
    echo "Adversarial reviewer .json not consumer-safe; one retry" >&2
    beril-adversarial review "$draft_dir" --type paper
    EXIT=$?
    if [[ $EXIT -ne 0 && $EXIT -ne 2 ]]; then
      echo "Persistent failure; manual escalation needed" >&2
      # Fall back to fallback_reviewer.v1.md if you still need a
      # review for this drafting cycle.
    fi
    ;;
  3)
    # Config error: claude CLI missing, prompt missing, etc.
    # User must fix install. Don't retry.
    exit $EXIT
    ;;
esac
```

**On the v0.7+ review-rewrite loop (planned):** when paper-writer
adds a loop that consumes the JSON to drive revise prompts, the
intended pattern is:

```python
import json
findings = json.load(open(f"{draft_dir}/audit/adversarial_review.json"))["findings"]
for f in findings:
    if f["severity"] == "P0":
        # Route by fix_target field. Each value names a paper-writer
        # prompt: results.v1.md, methods.v1.md, abstract.v1.md, etc.
        # See SCHEMA_V2_PAPER_DECISIONS.md §"fix_target values".
        invoke_revise_prompt(
            target_prompt=f["fix_target"],
            section=f.get("section"),  # absent for manuscript-wide findings
            line_range=f.get("line_range"),
            paragraph_quote=f.get("paragraph_quote"),
            issue=f["issue"],
            fix_hint=f["fix_hint"],
        )
# After the revise pass, re-run the reviewer to measure improvement.
```

**Coordinating with `fallback_reviewer.v1.md`:** the fallback
reviewer is intentionally lighter scope (3 detection classes vs
canonical's 10). Both modes can coexist:
- Fallback for fast in-loop iteration during drafting (cheap,
  narrow).
- Canonical for thorough audit passes (full 10 classes, dual
  output, JSON for consumer-loop use).

paper-writer team picks the default. Both are valid.

## Workflow example — presentation-maker's perspective

The intended call flow for presentation-maker's `revise_loop.py`
after `merge_and_assemble` produces a deck:

```python
import json
import subprocess
import sys

def adversarial_review(draft_dir):
    """Invoke beril-adversarial review on a presentation draft.
    Returns parsed JSON if consumer-safe; raises if not."""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["beril-adversarial", "review", str(draft_dir),
         "--type", "presentation"],
        capture_output=True, text=True,
    )
    sys.stderr.write(result.stderr)  # surface validator output

    # ... etc
```

**Layout-detection awareness:** presentation-maker v0.3.1+ uses a
4-zone draft directory (`deliverable/`, `narrative/`, `working/`,
`audit/`). The orchestrator auto-detects this layout (added v0.5.2)
and reads `slide_spec.json` from `working/` if present, else from
the top level (legacy v0.3.0). `revise_loop.py` doesn't need to
know which layout — the reviewer handles both transparently.

**The audit/ directory is shared:** both presentation-maker (which
may write its own audit artifacts) and beril-adversarial (which
writes `adversarial_review.{md,json}`) co-exist in
`<draft_dir>/audit/`. Filename collision is avoided by the
canonical names; if presentation-maker adds new audit artifacts in
the future, prefix them clearly to keep the namespace clean.

## Cross-skill smoke test responsibility

Each consumer skill SHOULD have a smoke test that verifies its output
structure passes adversarial-skill's input validation. The
adversarial-skill side has `tests/integration/test_paper_writer_interop.py`
(added v0.6.0) that builds a synthetic paper-writer-shaped fixture
and asserts the orchestrator accepts it without input-validation
errors.

Paper-writer's responsibility (separate repo): a smoke test that
constructs a typical paper-writer output directory and invokes
`beril-adversarial review --type paper <draft_dir>` to verify the
canonical reviewer accepts the output structure.

When this contract changes (e.g., adding required input files,
renaming output paths, bumping schema version), BOTH smoke tests
need to be updated AND the consumer skills need coordinated releases.

## Coordinating retirement of paper-writer's fallback_reviewer.v1.md

paper-writer ships a `prompts/fallback_reviewer.v1.md` (291 lines,
3 detection classes — overclaim, citation rigor, throughline-
alignment) that runs as the in-loop reviewer when canonical
adversarial isn't available.

**The fallback reviewer is intentionally lighter scope and serves a
different purpose.** It is NOT a workaround to remove. After v0.6.0
of beril-adversarial lands, paper-writer can:

- Option A: Keep both. Use fallback for fast in-loop iteration; use
  canonical (`beril-adversarial review --type paper`) for thorough
  audit passes (e.g., before final draft).
- Option B: Switch to canonical by default; deprecate fallback.

The decision belongs to paper-writer team. This contract just makes
both options possible.
